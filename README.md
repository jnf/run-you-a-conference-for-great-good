# Run You a Conference For Great Good
- Where's the money come from?
- What should you throw money at?
- Aftercare for Your Conference Organizer

## First things First
### Why do you want to run a conference?
+ help build your community
+ get participation credit outside of "lots of open source commits"

### Mission statement
+ Write up a mission statement
+ Start by figuring out the "elevator pitch" - a 20-30 second explanation of what your conference is about and who it serves
+ From there, work on a more complete write up of ~2 paragraphs
+ Identify and document the ideals and values you'll operate under
  + not a CoC, but what are the bullet point goals you can refer back to whenever you're making a decision - will the thing I'm about to do serve or harm this conference?

## Taking Care of Business
The least fun, for me anyway, is managing the business aspects of running a conference. Anytime you ask people for money in exchange for goods and services, you're gonna have some business concerns. And some liability. Protect yourself, your event, and your community by doing the research and planning ahead.

### LLC
Creating an LLC is surprisingly easy. It's a couple of forms on the internet for the state and federal governement. Doing so gave us an entity that:

1. Let us collect money
2. Let us spend money
3. Provide liability protection for ourselves and our families

### Accountants & Taxes
Those are pretty important things for a conference. Also, please don't forget to follow up with a tax accountant in your area. Earmark some money for them early on as they will repeatedly (and patiently, if you're lucky) remind you of all the nitpicky tax stuff that will come up. Depending on your location and plans, you may have to do things like collect and pay sales tax, use tax, amusement tax, income tax, or some combination of taxes. If you're not a tax professional, hire one.

### Bank Accounts
As soon as you have a federal tax ID for the LLC, go open a bank account. Turns out opening a "business checking" account is moderately more involved than a personal checking account. Took me three trips to the bank to finally get it right. Seperate accounts for the LLC means no cloudiness in what is conference money and what isn't. If it's a conference expense, it's paid with conference money from the LLC bank accounts and documented in the budget. Setting clear expectations and patterns here provides both an excellent paper trail for your accountant (they will thank you) and should guide any conversation about when/where/on whom conference money is spent.

### Business Licenses
In pursuit of Minimum Viable Conference, I asked our first sponsor (the illustrious Starr Horne @ Honeybadger) what he needed from us to be able to give us a check. His answer was a tax id and mailing address. So I did exactly enough work to make those happen. I got the LLC put together, registered for a federal tax id, and sent Starr an invoice. He promptly paid and his early confidence got us off the ground.

Turns out, while that was enough on Starr's end, there were a few more things for me to do. Most cities and/or states have business licensing requirements and even though we were never interested in turning a profit, the city was still expecting us to _act_ like a business. That means getting a business license from the city, registering with the state Department of Revenue, and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. I am a terrible businessperson. Find someone knowledgeable, pay them to help you, and heed their advice. Shout out to my boy Patrick at CPM CPA in Seattle!

### Insurance
Every venue I've worked with has included a clause in their contract requiring the LLC to secure "event insurance." This is a liability policy that protects the venue in the case of something going terribly, terribly wrong. To set this up, you'll need twenty minutes, a telephone, and probably something like $100. It's refreshingly inexpensive, wholly mundane, and everyone will feel better when it's in place. I picked our insurance agent because the name of the agency made me laugh (Tripple, Tripple & Tripple). Our two-day, single-track event for 300 people cost us about $90 to meaningfully insure.

## Managing Organizer Expectations
### Decision making
### Discussions around shared values/goals
### Empowering people, especially first-time organizers
### Consensus vs Deadlines

## Choosing Presenters
In our goal of creating a conference that the most number of people will enjoy (and find value in attending) you are in charge of curating the content. Similar to how movie studios have "tent pole releases" that they are reasonably sure will generate a large return, as an organizer a common approach is to find a handful of speakers who are talented and available to give talks, workshops, or other presentations on topics relevant to your conference. If announced early enough, these invited speakers can set not only the tone of the CFP submissions you'll receive and drive interest in potential attendees, but can help maximize your outreach beyond your own personal social networks and communities.

For example, most of the organizers of OSFeels are Rubyists, but by getting a few high-profile Python and Node speakers, we were able to generate a large number of attendees and talk submissions from those communities, by leveraging the connections of those speakers. It also opened a number of sponsors we hadn't previously identified as possible sources of support.

### Inviting Folks
+ it doesn't hurt to ask
+ ask early
+ make them feel special, because they are
+ give them as much info and support as you can
+ stay in contact and keep them informed about progress
  + invited speakers are an asset - keep them happy!
+ once they accept, work with them to identify communities and sponsors for additional outreach
  + they get publicity, too, so they want to help promote their appearance on your stage

### Running a CFP
+ web based
+ blind it as much as you can
+ give as much information about the nuts and bolts as you can
  + expected length
  + expectations you have of speakers
    + submit slides for review?
    + attend a conference event to meet-n-greet
    + will you be video taping? will talks then be freely available? Get a release!
  + what compensation (honorium? travel? hotel? free ticket at least?) are you offering?
+ offer example questions you want talks to address, or generic topics you'd like submissions on - don't expect speakers to work in a vacuum building custom content for your community
+ have a link to your CoC to remind folks of content expectations
