# Outro
Our hope is that you use the information we've presented to create similar efforts. I don't really care what the focus or theme of your event is, just that you find something you care about enough to want to bring a bunch of strangers together to examine it, celebrate it, improve upon it.

Open Source & Feelings is a pretty silly name for something that ended up being so serious. The levity in the name, the jokes it inspired, exist to provide balance to difficult conversations about burnout, isolation, homogeny, and discrmination. It also was a platform for discussions about joy, finding a niche to call your own in a daunting industry, and not just making space for, but appreciating and celebrating the contributions of diverse, inclusive teams and products.

I can look back on our effort. Our successes and failures, and feel good about what we accomplished. Our hypothesis on the Minimum Viable Conference was more or less confirmed. Events like OS&F and Mountain West are important. They provide opportunity to elevate ideas and voices that can improve our abilities, our understanding, our workflows, our relationships, and more. As we begin work on OS&F 2016, I am confident in our ability to provide value--real, tangible, meaningful value--to attendees, presenters, sponsors, and my fellow organizers.

All of these events, like any other product we build, come with a cost. These regional conferences are a labor of love, done because we believe in our collective ability to learn, to teach, to inspire, and to change things for the better. Whether it's technique or technology, code or communication, these events are the soapboxes we need to move forward as an industry.

Thank you.
