## Inviting Folks
In our goal of creating a conference that the most number of people will enjoy (and find value in attending) you are in charge of curating the content. Similar to how movie studios have "tent pole releases" that they are reasonably sure will generate a large return, as an organizer a common approach is to find a handful of speakers who are talented and available to give talks, workshops, or other presentations on topics relevant to your conference. If announced early enough, these invited speakers can set not only the tone of the CFP submissions you'll receive and drive interest in potential attendees, but can help maximize your outreach beyond your own personal social networks and communities.

For example, most of the organizers of OSFeels are Rubyists, but by getting a few high-profile Python and Node speakers, we were able to generate a large number of attendees and talk submissions from those communities, by leveraging the connections of those speakers. It also opened a number of sponsors we hadn't previously identified as possible sources of support.

+ it doesn't hurt to ask
+ ask early
+ make them feel special, because they are
+ give them as much info and support as you can
+ stay in contact and keep them informed about progress
  + invited speakers are an asset - keep them happy!
+ once they accept, work with them to identify communities and sponsors for additional outreach
  + they get publicity, too, so they want to help promote their appearance on your stage

## Running a CFP
+ web based
+ blind it as much as you can
+ give as much information about the nuts and bolts as you can
  + expected length
  + expectations you have of speakers
    + submit slides for review?
    + attend a conference event to meet-n-greet
    + will you be video taping? will talks then be freely available? Get a release!
  + what compensation (honorarium? travel? hotel? free ticket at least?) are you offering?
+ offer example questions you want talks to address, or generic topics you'd like submissions on - don't expect speakers to work in a vacuum building custom content for your community
+ have a link to your CoC to remind folks of content expectations
