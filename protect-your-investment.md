# Protect Your Investment
The least fun, for me anyway, is managing the business aspects of running a conference. Anytime you ask people for money in exchange for goods and services, you're gonna have some business concerns. And some liability. Protect yourself, your event, and your community by doing the research and planning ahead.

## LLC
Creating an LLC is surprisingly easy. It's a couple of forms on the internet for the state and federal government. Doing so gave us an entity that:

1. Let us collect money
2. Let us spend money
3. Provide liability protection for ourselves and our families

## Accountants & Taxes
Those are pretty important things for a conference. Also, please don't forget to follow up with a tax accountant in your area. Earmark some money for them early on as they will repeatedly (and patiently, if you're lucky) remind you of all the nit-picky tax stuff that will come up. Depending on your location and plans, you may have to do things like collect and pay sales tax, use tax, amusement tax, income tax, or some other combination of taxes. If you're not a tax professional, hire one.

## Bank Accounts
As soon as you have a federal tax ID for the LLC, go open a bank account. Turns out opening a "business checking" account is moderately more involved than a personal checking account. Took me three trips to the bank to finally get it right. Separate accounts for the LLC means no cloudiness in what is conference money and what isn't. If it's a conference expense, it's paid with conference money from the LLC bank accounts and documented in the budget. Setting clear expectations and patterns here provides both an excellent paper trail for your accountant (they will thank you) and should guide any conversation about when/where/on whom conference money is spent.

## Business Licenses
In pursuit of Minimum Viable Conference, I asked our first sponsor (the illustrious Starr Horne @ Honeybadger) what he needed from us to be able to give us a check. His answer was a tax id and mailing address. So I did exactly enough work to make those happen. I got the LLC put together, registered for a federal tax id, and sent Starr an invoice. He promptly paid and his early confidence got us off the ground.

Turns out, while that was enough on Starr's end, there were a few more things for me to do. Most cities and/or states have business licensing requirements and even though we were never interested in turning a profit, the city was still expecting us to _act_ like a business. That means getting a business license from the city, registering with the state Department of Revenue, and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. I am a terrible businessperson. Find someone knowledgeable, pay them to help you, and heed their advice. Shout out to my boy Patrick at CPM CPA in Seattle!

## Insurance
Every venue I've worked with has included a clause in their contract requiring the LLC to secure "event insurance." This is a liability policy that protects the venue in the case of something going terribly, terribly wrong. To set this up, you'll need twenty minutes, a telephone, and probably something like $100. It's refreshingly inexpensive, wholly mundane, and everyone will feel better when it's in place. I picked our insurance agent because the name of the agency made me laugh (Tripple, Tripple & Tripple). Our two-day, single-track event for 300 people cost us about $90 to meaningfully insure.

## Money is an unfortunate side effect of conference organizing
When you get started, you'll have no ideas how much anything is gonna cost. That's ok. Sit down in front of a spreadsheet and dream up some numbers. A half hour of internet research will get you a basic idea of what banquet halls go for in your area. Ditto catering, renting transportation, hotel blocks, and tshirt printing. Whatever it is you're interested in.

Put each item that either costs of makes money in one column in the spreadsheet. The next column is your best guess--educated or otherwise--on how much you'll spend or make on that thing. The third and fourth columns are blank. They are what the thing actually costs or brings in and on what day that must happen, respectively. Tally the moneies in a another row or column and congratualtions, you've got a working budget. This isn't a line-item ledger of expenditure; it's a high-level accounting of how money is entering and exiting your accounts.

There were more than a few decisions at OS&F last year that hinged on _when_ money was available.

> Yeah, we end up net-positive whether we bought Item X or not, if I buy Item X today, can we pay Vendor Y tomorrow?

Have that budget open in front of you during every organizer meeting.

__Decisions are driven by adherence to or support of the organization mission and the available budget.__
