# PeopleOps: Managing Organizer Expectations
Like most endeavors, the real challenge is in the relationships. Every organizer will bring with them a unique vision of the event, a set of goals and anxieties, and a different combination of skills.

When we started this thing, we approached it like a bunch of open source developers starting a new project. Because that's what we were. We applied our understanding of work to the task at hands. Our organizer meetings were like sprint planning. Slack became an asynchronous swirl of half-conversations, standup-style checkins, and in-jokes.

In our day-jobs as developers, certainly folks are empowered to steer the ship. The hierarchy is often formal, with project managers, team leads, and dev managers. These power structures come with their own problems, but, in their absence, projects will often spiral out of control.

For OS&F, difficulties with decision making, accountability, and communication breakdowns slowed our efforts. Given that we were 100% volunteer driven, how were we to hold folks accountable for missing a deadline or not completing a task?

As the months wore on, it became apparent that our defacto mode of consensus building for every decision was not going to work. There just wasn't enough time to discuss and reach consensus on every detail. So folks took chances. Kerri and I designed and ordered the attendee badges without involving the other organizers. Utah pushed ahead with converting the restrooms at the venue to be all-gender. I'm pretty sure I asked someone if it was cool to give free tickets to all my students, but I'm not positive who or when or what they said.

Acting in this manner had consequences. Relationships were strained and damaged. Meetings grew tense, and asking for an update on a task could result in that task being unceremoniously dumped in your lap. It wasn't fun, and organizing became a chore, a job, a necessity to see the thing through.

And we did. We persevered, and through equal parts grit and luck, kept the promises we'd made to attendees, speakers, and each other.

About a month after the conference, we held a formal retrospective. We brought in (and paid) a professional facilitator to lead discussions. Our goal was to identify the pain and pleasure points of organizing, and identify the things we'd want to do differently next year. It was a good idea, and even if your organizing efforts are all sunshine and rainbows, take the time to review and reflect on that effort. Maybe future efforts could be even better.

Here are some takeaways from our retrospective and subsequent discussion.

## Have an Organizer Code of Conduct.
This is different than your event's Code of Conduct. It's there for similar reasons--to outline acceptable and unacceptable behaviors and processes/consequences for both--but it's tailored for a different audience. This will provde a minimal formal structure to ground discussions and resolve disagreements.

When Bri proposed this, the idea struck me as equal parts brilliant and novel. It shouldn't have been novel; it makes too much damn sense and I don't know why it never occurred to me before. You can read ours at http://www.osfeels.com/organizer-code-of-conduct/. It outlines our expectations for each others, and provides a framework for addressing and resolving conflict. As we work on 2016's event, we've referred to it several times already, and just having the language on hand to guide discussions has been beneficial.

## Document Your Decision Making
Write things down. Write down that you decided to write things down. Put that thing you wrote down about writing things down somewhere that all the orgnaizers can see. Give it an ominous title like __This page will help us remember decision points that we have made for the 2016 conference. <3__ Tell yourselves that if it's not in the decision list, then it's not decided. Tell yourselves that if it is on the decision list, then it is decided. Be specific. Here are examples:

### Bad
We decided to run a CFP.

### Good
- We are going to use Blinder to run our CFP again.
- We approved the list of questions for the CFP with minor additions (no subtractions). See the blinder repo for the finalized questions.
- If we do workshops, we will run a separate CFW (call for workshops).
- We will invite TAFT to participate in the CFP.

### Even Better
- __Jeremy__ to deploy new blinder instance for 2016 CFP (due 3/7).
    - list of questions are approved; minor additions (no subtractions) to last year's questions
    - finalized list of questions already in the blinder repo.
- We want to run workshops
    - If we can, it will be separate CFW (call for workshops) process
    - __Kerri__ to contact venue about availability/capacities of rooms for workshops (due 3/14)
- we want to invite TAFT to participate in the CFP.
    - Exact details of participation TBD
    - More discussion needed, but we know we would like them to be involved

Etc. These look like _notes_, and they are, but they're notes about _decisions_. By attaching names to these notes/decisions, we can introduce some accountability. I'm a volunteer and if I couldn't get our CFP software up and running by 3/7, no one is gonna fire me. But it will be something we have to talk about at the next meeting. I will feel some obligation to put in the time to get it done; it's in my nature. Put my name on a task and I feel some ownership. It's outcome is attached to my sense of accomplishment, and I don't want to let my co-organizers down.

### Empower People, Especially First-Time Organizers
As a signatory on the bank account and the LLC, I became a bottleneck and pressure point on a lot of decisions. If it involved money, it would eventually have to filter through me and I was perceived as having a kind of implicit veto. If I disagreed with something, I could just not write the check, effectively disenfranchising my co-organizers and devaluing their efforts. This was especially daunting for first-time organizers.

This year, though my role is much the same, my tactics are different. In every meeting, I'm giving a budget update and putting it in terms of "our budget." Instead of asking folks to blindly plan an activity and "let me know what it'll cost," I'm asking questions like "is $700 a reasonable budget for this?" Though it seems like the former is less restrictive, first-time organizers may not know what's reasonable for a speaker's dinner or a facility rental. Giving a starting point allows for a more productive conversation. It involves them as a decision maker more directly. They may say "I'm not sure," but even then, they can use that $700 as a metric in their research and planning.

### Mindfulness in Organizer Communication
Explicitly collect and document every organizer's preferred mode of communication. Some folks will be in chat all day. Some folks work in restricted environments and won't have Slack access in daytime hours. Others may not be able to respond to evening emails, or have notifications on their mobile phones. Misunderstandings, perceived slights, and other conflicts often arise due to a mismatch in communication preferences. Take the time to document how to reach folks. Reference that document when you need to reach out to someone. Respect their boundaries and utilize the channels they've defined.

Doing so will increase the likelihood of timely responses, and indicate to the other person that you respect their time and value their input.
