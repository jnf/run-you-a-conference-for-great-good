# First Things First

## Why do you want to run a conference?
+ help build your community
+ get participation credit outside of "lots of open source commits"

## Mission statement
+ Write up a mission statement
+ Start by figuring out the "elevator pitch" - a 20-30 second explanation of what your conference is about and who it serves
+ From there, work on a more complete write up of ~2 paragraphs
+ Identify and document the ideals and values you'll operate under
  + not a CoC, but what are the bullet point goals you can refer back to whenever you're making a decision - will the thing I'm about to do serve or harm this conference?
