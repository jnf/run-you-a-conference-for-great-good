# Decisions We Could Have Made, But Didn't
If you're making a list of all the things you like about conferences, it is easy to go overboard and end up with a smorgasbord of every last thing your favorite conferences. Whether you're doing a Minimum Viable Conference or you've got a trust-fund from O'Reilly, it is important to think about each feature or event that you add, and ask "how does this serve our goals or mission statement?"

When we did that for OSFeels, a number of items that other conferences frequently feature were on our list, seemingly mandatory to our very idea of what a tech conference is, but ended up on the cutting room floor for solid reasons.

## Wifi
90% of conferences offer wifi, either a dedicated network provided by the venue, or a special access point brought in especially for the event. 90% of those end up being nearly immediately saturated with traffic, from work laptops, tablets, phones, and who knows what other devices that people tote to the conference space. Conference wifi is usually so bad that it's an unfunny joke to complain about it being crappy.

Ultimately we decided to not offer wifi, and to not pass out the venue access credentials unless someone asked us directly. In our post-conference feedback questionnaire, a number of attendees pointed this out as something they wished we would change, but we had good reasons.

### The venue's wifi wasn't super awesome
It was decent enough for the 10-15 people who needed it, primarily organizers and a few of our speakers, but having 200 people saturating it would make for a miserable experience.

### It was going to be expensive
We got a couple quotes and spoke with our conference organizer contacts/support group, and realized that while we certainly could pay several thousand dollars to have adequate wifi to serve a couple hundred tech people, what would that amount to per attendee?

> $4000 / 200 attendees = $20 per attendee

Adding in some padding to account for many of our attendees receiving free or half-price tickets, **we would've had to raise ticket prices $30 each to have dedicated wifi**. This simply did not fit with our mission of keeping the cost of attending as low as possible to make the conference accessible to as many as possible.

### It wasn't facilitating being present
Although not expressly captured in our mission statement, given the often personal and sensitive nature of the talks, that attendees should be as present in the moment as possible. Checking out of a talk and ducking into work Slack or gmail for a few minutes, or seeing what's happening on Reddit are at best a distraction for everyone around you, and at worst a rude or disrespectful act towards the speaker and other attendees.

One response we received to this policy was "But what if I had a work emergency?" If you attend a conference and are in a job that requires you to be on call, we assume you have means to do so, like a mifi or tethered phone.. and besides, its Seattle. Throw a rock in any direction and you'll hit a coffeeshop with free wifi where you can go and not take away from the communities experience.

## After Party
I, Kerri, love to drink. Jeremy, you enjoy a wee tipple from time to time, yes?

Not everyone does. There are lots of reasons why people don't like to drink, or don't like to be around alcohol. Beyond that, most after parties are loud, raucous events - they can be rough on those of us who are hard of hearing or are less outgoing. More and more conferences are choosing to make sure that their after parties are more inclusive, such as having an after party be a board game party, or as Madison Ruby did, got access to a children's museum after its regular hours - FUN!

Primarily we decided to not have an after party for very practical reasons -- we couldn't find a venue on a Friday or Saturday night on Capitol Hill that was affordable, and while we did have a couple leads, it became clear that we didn't have the people power to handle the logistics. We needed to think about

+ hours of access - could we have the space as late as we wanted?
+ accessibility - could a person with a cane, walker, or wheelchair easily get around the space?
+ safety - could we (or our private security guards) monitor who was coming and going effectively?
+ location - is it near the venue, or are there low friction transit options?

We didn't find a suitable location until the week before the conference, and by that point we realized that we didn't have enough time (or energy!) left to pull off a really great event. I wish we had, though - a good event where attendees could socialize and continue to feel part of a temporary community of conference attendees would've really been a big win, and planning a solid after party is already on the list for next time around.

## Feeding Folks
Holy moly, food is expensive! It was going to cost us ~$30 a head, or around $6000 total to provide a catered meal for 200 people for each day! That is an amazingly high expense, especially since we know that:

+ many attendees will go "off site" for lunch with coworkers or friends
+ we'll never dial in all the food restrictions correctly, wasting food and leaving some people potentially unfed
+ some people would be priced out of attending by an $85 ticket instead of a $55 ticket
+ we would've had to provide extra space for tables to eat at, staging, cleanup, and a banquet license
+ it would've been such a complex affair that it would've required the near full-time attention of an organizer

With the price quote in hand, we decided instead to set people loose on the neighborhood, to spend (or not spend) their own money on food that they wanted to eat. If someone brought their own lunch from home, great. On a corporate per diem, great. Deal with it yourself, and lower the cost for everyone (as well as the organizational complexity for us.)

We used our Ada Developer Academy volunteers wisely, designating a dozen of them as Lunch Leaders. Each was given a destination restaurant to go to, so that no single lunch spot got entirely swamped with hungry attendees. Each Lunch Leader wrote the name of the restaurant and its cuisine -- diner food, Indian, pizza, Russian dumplings -- on a sign, and held it aloft in the theatre lobby. When they'd gathered around them a rough group of about what we felt that restaurant could hand, away they'd go! We gave them the advice to NOT try to sit the entire group together, which forced groups of 4-6 to sit together at separate tables, furthering one of our goals of getting different groups of people interacting.

One side effect was that the neighborhood itself became part of the conference, as people got outside the confines of the venue and got to explore Capitol Hill with its funky stores, its issues of tech gentrification against existing "Gayborhood" residents, capturing a lot of the current character of Seattle. It also provided a richer experience for attendees to intermingle and have space to talk about the conference and the talks they'd seen outside of the venue of the conference itself. Such a distance allowed for some really great discussions to occur, judging from the number of groups that said they missed the start of the afternoon sessions because they were lingering over empty plates!
